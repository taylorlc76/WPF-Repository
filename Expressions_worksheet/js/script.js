//var humanYears = 1; //this is the variable that changes based on how many human years old the dog is

//dogYears = 7; //this is the variable that does not change 

//var result = humanYears * dogYears; //this variable shows that based on the number of human years the dog is, it will always be calculated against 7 years to get the age of the dog in dog years
