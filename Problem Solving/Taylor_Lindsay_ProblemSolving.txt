In this scenario, a man needs to figure out a way to get a cat and parrot over to the other side of a river without the cat with the parrot or the parrot with a bag of seed; the man can only bring one thing with him in the boat to the other side. 

I know that I cannot leave the parrot with the cat or the seed because one or the other will be eaten. A possible solution is that I take the bird with me on the first trip so that the cat is stuck with the seed, which it does not want. According to this solution, once the bird is brought to the other side, it will fly off in whichever way it desires so that once I bring over the cat or the seed, it will be gone and no temptation from the bird or cat will happen. 

Socks In the Dark:

In this scenario, I need to figure out the shortest times I reach into the sock drawer to get at least one matching pair and then determine the shortest amount of times to get a matching pair of each color when there are 20 socks in the drawer. 10 of them are black, 6 of them are white, and 4 of them are white.

I need to make sure that I am figuring out getting matching pairs and not the probability of the socks in the drawer. A possible solution is to actually label my own socks and test out the theory in real life.

Predicting Fingers:In this scenario, I need to know which finger will the girl land on when she gets to the numbers 10, 100, and 1000. 

I have to keep in mind that the girl skips the pinkie finger on the even waves of counting on her hands. A potential solution is that I physically do the counting the way the girl does in the problem until I reach these numbers.
